This is the code for the [CSTM paper](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~lcharlin/papers/cf_w_si_kdd.pdf)


* The main file is `ctm_pca_keywords.m`, it contains the code that calls over the
e- and m-steps and check the validation/test errors. This file doesn't load the
code (and various other needed parameters though).
